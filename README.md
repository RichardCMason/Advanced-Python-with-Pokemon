# Advanced-Python-with-Pokemon

In this notebook I developed a functional Pokemon-themed game that could simulate players acquiring pokemon and adding them to their pokedex, traveling to gyms, and battling against other players with their pokemon.  The program also analyzed pokemon stats and distributions of skills.  

Overall, the project was an excellent learning exercise.
